# programming-in-physical-world

## About

This repo contains code samples for showing CS concepts in physical world using robots, for Oregon State University's CS 161 & CS 162 classes on Ecampus.

The code has only been tested on the [Finch 1.0 robot by BirdBrain Technologies](https://www.birdbraintechnologies.com/finch/)

## Usage

### Setup

#### If you have the Finch robot:
Clone this repo's files in the same directory as `finch.py` and `finchconnection.py` that you setup for your Finch robot. 


#### If you don't have the Finch robot:
Clone this repo's files and rename `finch.dummy.py` to `finch.py`.


### How to use?

1. Understand how the code works by running it without any modifications.
1. Step through the code step-by-step by using PyCharm debugger or such utility to understand the finer points.
1. Change the code as described in the question comments. Look for "QUESTION" in the code. STOP and read the next step.
1. Now *before* running the code again, think about how the code should behave.
1. Run the code and see if your predictions are true.
